Silence. Absolute silence.
That's what Carl heard after an hour in the jungle.
Maybe two. Maybe three. Maybe even more. Carl didn't know.
He was all alone in the jungle at night, lost. He had lost his compass, his bag, his watch, and his whole bag.
He was panting and his legs were weary.
He licked his lips, missing the taste of water.
His stomach rumbled and grumbled.
He had been desperately looking for a way out of the dense jungle for a long time.
The dark night sky made it hard to see his surroundings, and the thorny leaves made it hard to walk.
Carl's legs felt like they were going to give way.
He slowly collapsed to the ground, helpless and simply exhausted.
He let out one last breath, and muttered, "Help me..."
Darkness engulfed him.
